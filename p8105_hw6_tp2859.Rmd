The plot provides an insightful visual representation of gender-related differences in homicide resolution across cities. While most cities show no significant disparity (OR ≈ 1), a few cities—Albuquerque, NM; Stockton, CA; Fresno, CA; New York, NY; Baton Rouge, LA; and Cincinnati, OH—exhibit notable deviations, warranting further investigation into local factors affecting homicide resolution.

# Load the dataset

# Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation
# Update data cleaning with the correct number of labels
birthweight <- birthweight %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex, labels = c("Male", "Female")),
    malform = factor(malform, labels = c("Absent", "Present")),
    frace = case_when(
      frace == 1 ~ "White",

The model I proposed is using following data:
Gestational Age (gaweeks): Longer gestational age is strongly associated with higher birthweight.
Mother's Weight Gain (wtgain): Increased weight gain during pregnancy is linked to better fetal growth.
Mother's Pre-pregnancy BMI (ppbmi): Maternal nutritional status can significantly impact fetal growth.
Mother's Race (mrace): Maternal race/ethnicity often reflects socioeconomic and health disparities affecting birthweight.
Presence of Malformations (malform): Structural malformations may reduce birthweight.
Mother's Height (mheight): Taller mothers tend to have larger infants due to their larger body frames.
```{r}
# Step 2: Propose a Primary Model
# Include predictors: mother's weight gain, gestational age, and mother's height
set.seed(123)
proposed_model <- lm(
  bwt ~ gaweeks + wtgain + ppbmi + mrace + malform + mheight,
  data = birthweight
)
model1 <- lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight)

# Model 2: Head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
model2 <- lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = birthweight)

```

```{r}
